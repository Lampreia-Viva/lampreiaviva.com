In the studio, we offer the possibility of multitrack recording with up to 18 simultaneous channels, using a Focusrite 18i20 audio interface. The studio features a diverse selection of hardware, both analogue and digital, providing flexibility in sound capture and processing.

We provide a range of microphones, including Shure, Sontronics, AKG, and Beyerdynamic. This variety allows us to capture different instruments or voices, selecting the most suitable microphone and recording method for the specific frequency range. This ensures audio capture can be tailored to meet the needs of each project.

# Room 1

This room is ideal for live recordings, instrument tracking, and music production. It can also be used for audio livestreams of concerts.
# Room 2

This room is designed for isolated voice recording, voice-over, narration, and other voice-focused work. It features optimised acoustic isolation for this purpose. Additionally, it can support live recordings by ensuring the voice is isolated from the instruments.
