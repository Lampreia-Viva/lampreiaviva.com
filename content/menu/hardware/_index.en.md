Do you want to extend the lifespan of your equipment and avoid replacement?

We offer repair services for audio equipment, cables, speakers, amplifiers, and microphones, including diagnostics, component replacement, and general maintenance.  
The problem is identified, cables and connections are checked, and the internal functioning of the equipment is examined. Additionally, a cleaning is performed to ensure that dust and dirt do not affect the equipment.

Once the repair is complete, the equipment is tested to ensure everything is functioning correctly and the issue has been resolved.

All repairs are carried out by an electrical engineer.
