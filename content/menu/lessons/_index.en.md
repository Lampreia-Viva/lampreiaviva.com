## Music

We offer guitar, bass, and drums lessons tailored to different ages and learning paces, even for students with no musical background or prior experience.

## Music Production
We also teach music production, helping students understand the entire process from composition to the finalisation of a song. These lessons include topics such as multitrack recording, equalisation, mixing, using DAWs, setting up and organising studio racks, among others.

## Hardware Repair

For musicians who want to master the technical aspects of their craft and for more skilled music enthusiasts, we offer repair lessons specifically designed for this target group. These lessons cover topics such as cable maintenance, pedal repairs, and equipment fixing. The goal is to provide comprehensive learning to help students extend the life of their equipment and acquire practical skills to handle various technical issues.
