We provide live music recording and support for small-scale events, delivering a professional, high-quality experience. Our approach is fully customisable, tailored to the needs of each client, whether for concerts, live performances, music festivals, conferences, jam sessions, art exhibitions, theatre or comedy shows, or any other type of event.

For solo artists or bands, our goal is to capture a live performance that documents their work and can be used for promotional purposes. We work closely with musicians to ensure the recording reflects their artistic vision and the sound they wish to convey.

In addition to real-time recording and support, we also offer post-production services such as editing and mixing to ensure the final result is polished and professional.
